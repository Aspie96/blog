*This blog post is dedicated to the public domain through [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).*

*I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.*

The 1st of January is Public Domain Day: the day in which a new batch of works enters the public domain and becomes free for all to build upon, promoting progress, culture and creativity.

My first blog post on Public Domain Day was in [2024]({{< ref "/posts/pdd-2025" >}}). This is my second one. There isn't much to celebrate with regard to this blog, as I have only published [one]({{< ref "/posts/free-speech" >}}) post between these two. I am working locally, although very slowly, on other articles and I hope to publish more this year. In the meanwhile, I celebrate the public domain again through this post.

The duration of copyright protection [varies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_lengths) across jurisdiction, and so does what works enter the public domain today. The [Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/) features works in the public domain, most of which worldwide, but not all, according to the relevant [labels](https://publicdomainreview.org/rights-labelling-on-our-site/).

This year the original Popeye character enters the public domain in the United States, where it's treated as a work for hire, thus with a different copyright protection, while in Italy, which makes no such distinction, it has been unprotected since 2009, 70 years after the death of the author. Conversely, in Italy, which doesn't apply the rule of the shorter term to US works, the original Mickey Mouse, which was the most remarkable new entry to the public domain in the US last year, remains protected.

## Public domain software

Computer programs, whether in source or object code, are protected as literary works. In principle, like all other works, they are meant to enter the public domain automatically after the copyright term, but, due to the recent and evolving nature of software, there is no useful pool of programs that have.

Several computer programs and software libraries have been willingly dedicated to the public domain. This can happen through a waiver, such as the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/), or through [public-domain-equivalent licences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain-equivalent_license), such as the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/), the [Zero-Clause BSD](https://www.landley.net/toybox/license.html) licence or [MIT No Attribution License](https://opensource.org/license/mit-0/). When the source code of a public domain program is available, it also qualifies as free and open source software.

Below are some examples of public domain software:

- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): Popular and [widely used](https://www.sqlite.org/famous.html) database engine in the public domain written as a C library.
- [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) (along with its forks, such as [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)): Command-line program to download videos from several platforms dedicated to the public domain through the Unlicense. GitHub disabled access to the software following a questionable [notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md) by the [Recording Industry Association of America](https://www.riaa.com/), but then [reinstated](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca) it thanks to an [intervention](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/11/2020-11-16-RIAA-reversal-effletter.pdf) by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/), to which RIAA didn't respond. Following this incident, GitHub [updated](https://github.blog/news-insights/policy-news-and-insights/standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/) its policies to prevent undue project takedowns in the future.
- [re2c](https://re2c.org/): Lexer generator in the public domain which supports multiple programming languages and can even be extended to other ones.
- [Lemon](https://www.sqlite.org/lemon.html): Re-entrant and thread-safe parser generator in the public domain for the C language developed as part of the SQLite project.
- [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb): Collection of single-file libraries for C and C++ dedicated to the public domain through the Unlicense.
- [libcaca](http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca): Graphics library under the WTFPL which outputs text and can be used in a terminal emulator.
- Some video games, such as [Passage](https://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/), [kiki the nano bot](https://kiki.sourceforge.net/) and [The Castle Doctrine](https://sourceforge.net/p/hcsoftware/CastleDoctrine/ci/default/tree/).

Overall, despite its importance and validity, the public domain remains a relatively uncommon choice by software developers and most [free and open source software]({{< ref "/posts/free-software" >}}) is not in the public domain.

## Public domain datasets

Databases (or "compilations") are covered by copyright, if the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute the author's own intellectual creation, and, in the [European Union](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/1996/9/) and the [United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sui-generis-database-rights), by *sui generis rights*, according to a [sweat of the brow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_of_the_brow) doctrine, for a substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting their contents. These [database rights](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikilegal/Database_Rights) exist without prejudice to those subsisting in the works incorporated into a database.

Large amounts of high-quality data can make a great difference in the fields of machine learning and data mining. The practice of training models on data collected through web scraping has sparked debate and raised legal questions which are yet to be answered.

The availability of public domain datasets of public domain material can reduce legal uncertainty regarding the use of data, of trained models and of their outputs.

Databases can be dedicated to the public domain through [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), the [Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/) or other similar legal tools.

Below I describe some datasets of interest:
- [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/), hosted by [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/), is a multi-language text-to-speech dataset built as a cooperative effort which can be used to train speech-enabled applications. It is made available under the CC0 public domain dedication. Contributors [agree](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/terms) to have their contributions offered to the public under CC0.
- [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), a [Wikimedia](https://www.wikimedia.org/) project, is a multilingual knowledge base of structured data. It is built and maintained cooperatively and all of its data is available for [download](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_download) and released under CC0.
- [Public Domain 12M](https://source.plus/pd12m), recently released by [Spawning](https://spawning.ai/), is a large dataset of image and caption pairs. Images are collected from various sources which have labelled them with either CC0 or the [Public Domain Mark](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/pdm/), while captions are machine-generated. The dataset itself is not in the public domain. Instead, it is released under the [Community Data License Agreement - Permissive - Version 2.0](https://cdla.dev/permissive-2-0/), a free and open data licence which does not impose any restriction or obligations with respect to the use, modification, or sharing of results, including machine learning models.

A fundamental axiom of copyright is that it cannot protect facts and databases are, commonly, largely factual. The boundary between protectable and unprotectable elements of a database can be hard to determine and relevant legal questions regarding the use of data remain unanswered. In addition, data is often compiled from multiple sources, increasing the complexity of providing attribution in the specific fashion required by licences and potentially leading to recursive attribution stacking.

The public domain is a good option for maximizing the reusability of data, especially when intended for scientific purposes. CASIMIR Rome Meeting participants [recommended](https://www.nature.com/articles/461171a) that materials and data be shared under the least restrictive terms possible and advocated for strongly resisting any restrictions on use, suggesting the use of CC0.

CC0 is the default licensing options for data for some research repositories, such as [Figshare](https://help.figshare.com/article/copyright-and-license-policy) and multiple [Dataverse](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.5/user/dataset-management.html#license-terms) instances. [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) requires that all published data be in the public domain.

## Assets for software

Often, computer programs need to include, or to be combined with, elements which are not strictly software, such as art. Producing these can be time consuming and requires abilities a software developer might not have. The availability of public domain assets can be valuable.

[Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) releases its game assets under CC0. [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/) platform provides game art under free and open licences, much of which in the public domain.

The legal landscape of typefaces is complex and varies by jurisdiction. A large [collection](https://typodermicfonts.com/public-domain/) has been dedicated to the public domain through CC0 by Typodermic Fonts, a digital type foundry. Many more public domain typefaces can be found online, such as [Tuffy](http://tulrich.com/fonts/), [Programma](https://github.com/douglascrockford/Programma) and pixel fonts by [Not Jam](https://not-jam.itch.io/not-jam-font-pack).

## Italy's classical masterpieces

As I remarked last year, in Italy, some [articles](https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:2004-01-22;42~art106) in the Cultural Heritage Code [hinder](https://communia-association.org/2023/06/20/something-the-public-domain-is-rotting-in-the-state-of-italy/) the commercial uses of works which are parts of its rich cultural heritage.

The Cultural Heritage Code has lead to [decisions](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/arte/2023/05/15/tribunale-si-al-diritto-allimmagine-per-beni-culturali_2fa5a371-1732-4cc7-bc7c-398a7c7a1341.html) against uses of [David](https://www.galleriaaccademiafirenze.it/opere/david-michelangelo/) by [Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo), which have attracted [criticism](https://www.wikimedia.it/news/unaltra-ordinanza-sulle-immagini-del-david-unoccasione-persa/). It's also not the only [work](https://communia-association.org/2023/03/01/the-vitruvian-man-a-puzzling-case-for-the-public-domain/) being restricted for this reason.
